    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

It had washed ashore with the storm, nestled in a barnacle-crusted chest. The parchment was unlike any he’d seen, and under the lamplight, faint, pulsing lines of emerald glowed within its fibers. They weren’t ink; they shifted, coalescing into shapes that hinted at unknown constellations and submerged, glittering cities. His rough fingers, accustomed to ropes and brass, trembled as he followed a particularly bright vein. It led, impossibly, to a point just beyond the treacherous Spires, a place no sane sailor dared venture. The map seemed to hum, a silent song calling him to the depths.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Flesh out Elias's motivations and internal state:** While the trembling fingers and the chill suggest apprehension, it would be beneficial to explore *why* Elias is drawn to this map. Is he seeking adventure, escape, or something specific? Briefly hinting at his past or current situation could deepen his character and make his potential journey more compelling.\n",
      "*   **Expand on the sensory details of the map:** The \"pulsing lines of emerald\" and the \"humming\" are excellent starting points. Consider adding more tactile or auditory details. Does the parchment feel unusually smooth or rough? Does the hum have a discernible pitch or texture? These details can make the magical element feel more grounded and immersive.\n",
      "*   **Foreshadow the \"why\" of the map's destination:** The Spires are mentioned as a dangerous, forbidden place. The map leading there is presented as the core mystery. To enhance anticipation, you could subtly hint at what might be found there or why Elias might feel a pull towards such a dangerous location. Is it a legend he's heard, a lost family treasure, or a personal quest?\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Elias traced the salt-etched lines of the ancient map, a chill unrelated to the sea breeze prickling his skin. Decades at the lighthouse, a life tethered to the predictable rhythm of the tides and the lonely sweep of the beam, had fostered a quiet resignation within him. He craved no grand adventure, only the solace of routine. Yet, this parchment, which had washed ashore with the storm nestled in a barnacle-crusted chest, stirred something dormant. It felt impossibly smooth beneath his calloused fingertips, far removed from the rough textures of his everyday life. Under the lamplight, faint, pulsing lines of emerald glowed within its fibers, not with the flat luminescence of ink, but with a life of their own. They shifted, coalescing into shapes that hinted at unknown constellations and submerged, glittering cities – whispers of a world beyond his solitary rock. His rough fingers, accustomed to ropes and brass, trembled not just with apprehension, but with a nascent, unfamiliar yearning. The map seemed to hum, a low, resonant thrum that vibrated in his very bones, a silent song calling him to the depths. He’d heard the old sailors’ tales, of course, of the treacherous Spires and the unnatural storms that guarded them, of ships that vanished without a trace. But the emerald vein pulsing on the map led, impossibly, to a point just beyond them. It was a place of myth, a siren’s call to oblivion. Yet, Elias found himself wondering, with a terrifying flicker of hope, if it might hold the answer to the gnawing emptiness that had settled in his heart since his daughter, Elara, was lost to the sea years ago, her name a whispered legend among the wrecks. The map, he suspected, held more than just routes; it held echoes of the lost.\n",

    "## ✅ Congratulations! You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n",
    "\n",
    "You used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
